# RegEx Tutorial

If you've ever seen "RegEx" in a project, you might be wondering what that even means. It stands for "Regular Expression", which is basically a curated search pattern used to match strings.

## Summary

Let's go over the regex to match an email. The most likely reason to do this would be to validate a new user's email address to be used for logging in to an application.

Here is the RegEx you'll be working toward:
('[a-z0-9]+@[a-z]+\.edu\.[a-z]{2,3}')

Here are some questions you might ask yourself before building your RegEx:

1. Will I need to include any special characters - if so, which ones?
2. Will letters be included - if so, will they be uppercase, lowercase, or both?
3. Will there be any literal characters or strings?
4. Will there be numbers to account for - if so, are all numbers acceptable? 


Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
